# GithubApp

A flutter github app.

## Setup

If you want a higher request rate per hour access to github API, create .env file in project root with following content:

*GITHUB_API_TOKEN='<YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>'*


Without the token, request rate is limited to 10 requests/h, and with it, it's 30 requests/h.
